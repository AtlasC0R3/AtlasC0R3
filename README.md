### hello you have reached atlasc0r3 yes?
*aka atlas_core on some platforms*

Anyways, hi. I'm a developer, I guess. I mean yeah, I write stuff and do technological stuff... but anyway. 
I write mainly in Python, and sometimes use Luau because of the Roblox engine *(not platform)*. 
~~I also don't like Windows as my main OS~~.

[I also have a Gitdab account](https://gitdab.com/atlas_core), this is where I'll post lesser-known projects, spare projects or miscellaneous stuff.
I suggest you check it out if you want to know *every* thing I make.

- Currently working on a Discord.py bot, [drop-bot](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-bot)
- Currently also working on a Roblox project that utilizes Spotify's HTTP API
- *Fun fact, Linux gaming isn't just "egegge use qemu for vm!!1!", it's much easier than that: it's using Proton, Wine and Lutris.*
- You can ask me questions about pretty much anything, I might not *answer* it but..
