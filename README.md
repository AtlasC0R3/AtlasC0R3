### hi
my name is atlas\_core. atlasc0r3 is my old username.

i'm a developer apparently. i guess i did write a game in c, and a few other things in python 3.
I write mainly in Python, although I have done a few things in C/C++ and other languages. 
~~I also don't like Windows as my main OS on my computer~~.

[I also have a Gitdab account](https://gitdab.com/atlas_core), this is where I'll put other stuff.

- [i made a c game](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/dotty)
- i also wrote some python 3 chat bot moderation backend thing named [drop-mod](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-mod) and wrote a discord bot named [drop-discord](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/drop-discord) based on that library
- *Fun fact, Linux gaming isn't just "egegge use qemu for vm!!1!", it's much easier than that: it's using Proton, Wine and Lutris, Proton being particularly useful and fun due to being included inside Steam.*
- i uh i like decentralized social media stuff because there's no skynet AI going to recommend me conspiracy theory stuff. what, do i look like the type of person to believe in government supremacy going to put 5G chips in child to sell their data? *what would they even have to sell?*
- i'm also an arch linux user that hates people who just say "i use arch btw" on any occasion such as a funeral or something.
- i hate most electron-based apps. i hate 'em.
- feel free to ask me questions. *just no weird stuff please*
- **CANADA.**
