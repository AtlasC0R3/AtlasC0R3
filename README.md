### hello you have reached atlasc0r3 yes?
*aka atlas_core on some platforms*

Anyways, hi. I'm a developer, I guess. I mean yeah, I write stuff and do technological stuff... but anyway. 
I write mainly in Python, and sometimes use Luau because of the Roblox engine *(not platform)*. 
~~I also don't like Windows as my main OS~~.

[I also have a Gitdab account](https://gitdab.com/atlas_core), this is where I'll post lesser-known projects, spare projects or miscellaneous stuff.
I suggest you check it out if you want to know *every* thing I make.
